# Voter-ID-Laws

Below are some sources I have used to collect data and create a dataset to be used to map the states. We know that 
voter identification requirements can effect voter efficacy so showing this in a new, impactful way is my goal.

* [source 1] (https://www.usa.gov/voter-id)
* [source 2] (https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_identification_laws_by_state)

My current map is just a basic visualization and upon making it I realized I would rather make a slippy map that can be interacted with so this is not reflective of what the final product will be. (If you are reading this at a time where there is an interactive map then please disregard this statement.)

*Final map will be interactive
*Final map will not be grayscale
*Final map will show all states appropriately
**I got the idea to have the smaller states that don't fit state labels visualized in boxes from a map I saw online. Again, this is just a basic visualization of the data I've collected for myself and is not the final product.
