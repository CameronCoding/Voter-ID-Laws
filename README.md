# Voter-ID-Laws

Below are some sources I have used to collect data and create a dataset to be used to map the states. We know that 
voter identification requirements can effect voter efficacy so showing requirement data in a new, impactful way (when connected with corresponding information) is my goal.

My current map is just a basic visualization and upon making it I realized I would rather make a slippy map that can be interacted with. This way states can be visualized more easily, I can provide more information when a user interacts with the state, and so in. That being said, this is not reflective of what the final product will be. (If you are reading this at a time where there is an interactive map then please disregard this statement.)

* Final map will be interactive 
* Final map will not be grayscale 
* Final map will show all states appropriately 
    * I got the idea to have the smaller states that don't fit state labels visualized in boxes from a map I saw online. While I think this could be effective for possibly educational purposes for print I don't believe it is effective or appropriate for my end goal.
